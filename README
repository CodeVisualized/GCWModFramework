MISC TOOLS:
There are a lot of tools out there for 
extracting game specific assets and/or modifying them.
The game you are modding may have a modding community on Discord/elsewhere 
that can point you in the right direction to tools for your chosen game.
Otherwise, browser searches will often require some digging to find things.
Either way, be careful about what you download.
